      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hi! I’m Aadya Madgula. This website helps my community learn about Artificial Intelligence in everyday life, why AI policy matters, and how to use AI tools safely and wisely.</p>

      <h2>Where You See AI</h2>
      <p>AI shows up in online shopping recommendations, healthcare diagnosis apps, smart traffic navigation, social media feeds, voice assistants, and even security cameras. Understanding where AI is used helps you think critically about how it affects your data and decisions.</p>

      <h2>AI Policy: Why It Matters and How It Works</h2>

      <h3>What is AI Policy?</h3>
      <p>AI policy is a growing set of  rules, laws, and ethical standards to make sure artificial intelligence is developed and implemented for the good of individuals and the public benefit. It covers how companies collect and use your data, whether AI decisions are fair and transparent, and who is responsible when AI hurts you. Good AI policy strikes the appropriate balance between technology innovation and protection by encouraging tech that makes life better without abuse, discrimination, or loss of privacy.</p>

      <h3>Who Makes AI Policy?</h3>
      <p>AI policy is a shared responsibility:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Governments</strong> write laws and regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Companies</strong> create internal guidelines and follow local laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Communities & watchdog groups</strong> advocate for people’s rights and push for stronger protections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Different countries handle it differently: The European Union leads with the GDPR; Canada has strong privacy laws; the United States has various state and federal rules but no single national AI law yet. Global organizations like OECD and UNESCO publish principles for responsible AI worldwide.</p>

      <h3>Key Questions AI Policy Tries to Answer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who is responsible when AI fails?</strong> Good policy clarifies who pays for harm when AI makes a mistake.</li>
        <li><strong>How do we prevent bias and discrimination?</strong> Policies require companies to test AI for fairness so it doesn’t discriminate unfairly.</li>
        <li><strong>When should companies disclose AI decisions?</strong> You should know when a machine, not a human, makes a choice that affects your life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Key Areas of AI Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Data Privacy:</strong> Protects your personal data; ensures companies ask permission, explain how data is used, and keep it secure.</li>
        <li><strong> Algorithmic Fairness:</strong> Requires AI to treat everyone fairly, regardless of background.</li>
        <li><strong> Transparency:</strong> Makes companies explain how AI works so you can understand and challenge unfair results.</li>
        <li><strong> Accountability:</strong> Ensures humans remain responsible when AI makes mistakes and requires audits to check AI performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Learn how your data is used.</li>
        <li> Ask questions about AI tools you use.</li>
        <li> Support groups that fight for fair AI laws.</li>
        <li> Vote for leaders who care about privacy and tech accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stay curious. Stay informed. Your voice helps shape the future of AI for everyone.</p>

      <h2>AI Safety Tips: How to Protect Yourself in a Connected World</h2>

      <p>AI makes life easier but also creates risks. Smart habits help you enjoy technology while protecting your privacy and security. Here’s how:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong> Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Different complex passwords for every account. Use a password manager to keep track securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication :</strong> Adds an extra code when logging in. Use an authenticator app for more security than text messages.</li>
        <li><strong> Check App Permissions:</strong> Limit access to your camera, mic, location. Review regularly in phone settings.</li>
        <li><strong> Mute Smart Speakers:</strong> Smart assistants can record by accident. Mute when not in use and delete old voice logs.</li>
        <li><strong> Keep Devices Updated:</strong> Updates fix security flaws hackers could exploit. Turn on automatic updates when possible.</li>
        <li><strong> Verify Information:</strong> AI chatbots can make mistakes. Double-check important advice (health, finance) with a real expert.</li>
        <li><strong> Be Scam-Smart:</strong> AI helps scammers write fake emails and calls. Never click unknown links, verify before sharing info.</li>
        <li><strong> Educate Your Family:</strong> Teach kids and older relatives how to spot scams and practice safe online habits together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Stay alert, share these tips with others, and keep learning!</p>
