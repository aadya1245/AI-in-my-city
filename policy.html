  <h2>AI Policy Basics</h2>

  <p>AI policy is the set of rules and ethical guidelines that make sure AI benefits everyone safely and fairly. These rules affect how companies use your data, how much transparency they owe you, and what rights you have if an AI decision harms you.</p>

  <p>Governments, businesses, and communities work together to shape these policies. Countries like Canada and the European Union lead the way with strong privacy laws and fairness rules, setting global standards that influence even companies in the United States.</p>

  <p>Key questions that AI policy tries to answer include: Who is responsible when AI makes a mistake? How can we prevent bias against minorities? How should companies tell you when AI is making decisions about your job, loan, or medical care?</p>

  <p>Some important areas of focus are:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Ensuring that your personal information is collected with your permission, stored safely, and not sold to third parties without your knowledge.</li>

    <li><strong>Algorithmic Fairness:</strong> Requiring companies to test AI systems for bias so they don’t discriminate based on race, gender, or other traits.</li>

    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Pushing companies to explain how their AI works so that users can understand and question decisions.</li>

    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Making sure humans stay in control and can be held responsible for AI’s actions.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>AI policy is not perfect yet — but it’s improving. When citizens know more, they can push for better laws and hold companies accountable. Learn, speak up, and stay involved: your voice helps shape the future.</p>
