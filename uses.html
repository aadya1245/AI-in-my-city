  <h2>Where You See AI</h2>

  <p>AI is woven into so many daily moments that we forget it’s there. The goal of this page is to help you spot where it quietly shapes your choices, routines, and experiences.</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Smart Shopping:</strong> Online stores use AI to recommend products, adjust prices in real-time, and even predict what you might buy next week based on what’s in your cart today.</li>

    <li><strong>Healthcare Diagnostics:</strong> AI helps detect diseases earlier by analyzing patterns in scans or lab tests that humans might miss. Some apps even let patients check symptoms before visiting a doctor.</li>

    <li><strong>Social Media Feeds:</strong> What you see on your feed is curated by AI. It predicts what will keep you scrolling longer and sometimes promotes posts based on your mood, interests, or clicks.</li>

    <li><strong>Navigation & Traffic:</strong> GPS apps like Google Maps use AI to analyze traffic in real time and suggest the fastest route. City planners also use this data to improve roads.</li>

    <li><strong>Voice Recognition:</strong> Smart assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Home use AI to interpret your commands and learn your speech patterns to get better over time.</li>

    <li><strong>Security & Surveillance:</strong> AI-powered cameras can identify suspicious activity in public spaces and help law enforcement monitor crowded events.</li>

    <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> AI writes simple news reports, generates subtitles for videos, and can even compose music or design graphics for businesses.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Every time you use an app or gadget, think: Is AI making a decision here? Knowing this helps you be aware of what data you share and how to protect yourself.</p>

  <p>Pay attention, ask questions, and share what you learn. The more we know, the smarter we can be about using AI wisely.</p>
