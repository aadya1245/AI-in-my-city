  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hi! I’m Aadya Madgula. I believe Artificial Intelligence should be understandable, fair, and safe for everyone. </p>

  <p>Besides studying software engineering and AI policy, I’m the president of Project CARE, where I organize tutoring, workshops, and charity drives. I also volunteer as a swim instructor, helping kids feel strong and confident in the water — just like I want people to feel about technology.</p>

  <p>I fell in love with tech not just because it’s cool, but because it’s powerful. But with great power comes responsibility. My goal is to build AI tools that help people, not exploit them, and to teach my community how to use these tools wisely.</p>

  <p>When I’m not coding or organizing, I love music, making videos, and practicing Taekwondo (I’m a secondary black belt!). These hobbies remind me that balance is key, whether it’s balancing tech with humanity or balancing work with rest.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you leave knowing a little more about AI — and feeling ready to ask questions, demand fairness, and share what you learn. Together, we can shape a tech future that works for all of us.</p>
