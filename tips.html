  <h2>Safety Tips</h2>

  <p>AI is powerful, but smart habits keep you safe. Here’s a bigger list of practical steps you can follow to protect your information and your peace of mind:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create unique passwords for each account. Consider a password manager to keep them secure.</li>

    <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Add an extra layer of security by requiring a code or app confirmation when logging in.</li>

    <li><strong>Check App Permissions:</strong> Review what your apps can access — like your camera, microphone, or contacts — and limit unnecessary permissions.</li>

    <li><strong>Mute Smart Speakers:</strong> Turn off the mic when not using voice assistants to prevent accidental recordings.</li>

    <li><strong>Update Regularly:</strong> Always install the latest updates for your devices to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>

    <li><strong>Verify Sources:</strong> Don’t trust everything an AI chatbot or automated reply says. Cross-check health and finance advice with a human expert.</li>

    <li><strong>Be Scam Aware:</strong> Watch out for phishing emails crafted with AI that look very real. Double-check links and email addresses.</li>

    <li><strong>Educate Family:</strong> Talk with kids and older family members about AI, scams, and privacy basics to keep everyone safe.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Being mindful doesn’t mean avoiding AI — it means using it on your terms. Stay alert and share these tips with people you care about.</p>
