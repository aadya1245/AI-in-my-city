  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>Hi! I’m [Your Name], a first-generation student at Las Positas College in the Bay Area. This website is my gift to my community — a way to break down complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics in everyday language that everyone can understand.</p>

  <p>AI is all around us — in our phones, our cars, our schools, and our workplaces. It makes things faster and easier, but it also raises questions about privacy, fairness, and how technology changes jobs and opportunities.</p>

  <p>When I first started studying AI, I realized that people often feel left out of conversations about new tech. I want to change that. You don’t need to be a programmer to understand how AI affects you or how to use it wisely.</p>

  <p>On this site, you’ll find practical examples of where AI shows up in your daily life, easy-to-understand explanations of AI policy and ethics, safety tips to keep your information secure, and my personal journey that inspired me to focus on responsible technology.</p>

  <p>My hope is that you’ll share what you learn here with family and friends. The more people understand AI, the better we can demand fair rules, safer tools, and more honest companies.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting. Explore each page, ask questions, and join me in making AI work for everyone — not just big tech companies.</p>
